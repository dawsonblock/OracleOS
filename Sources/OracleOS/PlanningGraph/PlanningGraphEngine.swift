// PlanningGraphEngine.swift — Deterministic planning graph for action selection.
//
// The planner operates over a finite action graph instead of generating
// arbitrary step sequences. Each edge represents a valid state transition
// with an associated ``ActionSchema``.
//
// Core algorithm:
//   current_state → query graph edges → rank edges → execute best edge
//
// Edge scoring:
//   score = success_rate − cost_penalty − latency_penalty
