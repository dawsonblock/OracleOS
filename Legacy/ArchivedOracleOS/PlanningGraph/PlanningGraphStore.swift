// PlanningGraphStore.swift — Reference-type wrapper around PlanningGraphEngine.
//
// PlanningGraphEngine is a value type for clean, deterministic semantics.
// This store provides reference semantics so the same graph instance can
// be shared between VerifiedActionExecutor (writes) and the planner
// (reads) without value-copy divergence.
