Oracle OS runs two agents on a single execution core — one controls your Mac, the other writes your code — sharing a unified trust boundary, policy engine, and verified execution path.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/dawsonblock/Oracle-OS.git
cd Oracle-OS
swift build

- 22 public MCP tools remain available under stable `oracle_*` names
- native local controller and bundled host process are working
- verified execution is active for the core interaction actions
- canonical observation snapshots are real and used by runtime logic
- planning-state abstraction is implemented and used as reusable graph state
- graph persistence is SQLite-backed
- policy and approval gating are active runtime concerns, not just scaffolding
- code-domain execution uses a workspace-scoped runner instead of unsafe shell UI control
- project memory, experiment fanout, and architecture review are implemented as bounded upper layers
- Reasoning Layer: Multi-coordinator architecture for decision, execution, learning, and recovery
# First-time setup
./.build/debug/oracle setup
./.build/debug/oracle doctor
```

> **Requirements:** macOS 14+, Swift 5.9+, Accessibility and Screen Recording permissions.

## ✨ Features

### 🖥️ macOS Operator Agent

Control apps, browsers, windows, and files through safe, verified action paths.

- **AX-first perception** — inspect UI state, capture screenshots and element context
- **Verified interactions** — click, type, press, focus, scroll, and window-manage with pre/post observation checks
- **Replayable recipes** — automate multi-step workflows as portable JSON
- **Policy & approval gating** — risky actions require explicit approval before execution

### 💻 Software Engineer Agent

Read code, edit files, run builds and tests — all scoped to your workspace.

- **Repository intelligence** — index structure, symbols, dependencies, and tests
- **Workspace-scoped execution** — file edits, builds, tests, and git ops without unsafe shell automation
- **Bounded experiments** — fan out candidate fixes in isolated git worktrees, ranked and replayed
- **Project memory** — retrieve prior design decisions and avoid already-failed approaches

### 🔗 Shared Substrate

Both agents share one runtime, one policy engine, one verified execution boundary, one trace system, one graph store, and one memory layer.

## 🏗 Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    Surface["Controller / MCP / CLI / Recipes"] --> Runtime["OracleRuntime"]
    Runtime --> Policy["Policy + Approval Gate"]
    Runtime --> Loop["Bounded AgentLoop"]
    Loop --> Observation["Observation + Planning State"]
    Loop --> Planner["OS Planner / Code Planner / Mixed Planner"]
    Planner --> PG["PlanningGraphEngine"]
    Planner --> Skills["OS Skills + Code Skills"]
    Skills --> Exec["VerifiedActionExecutor"]

    Exec --> Memory["App Memory + Code Memory"]
    Planner --> PM["Project Memory"]
    Planner --> Arch["Architecture Engine"]
    Planner --> Exp["Parallel Experiments (Code)"]
```

Every action flows through:

> **Observe → Abstract → Plan → Gate → Execute → Trace → Learn**

This makes the system slower to overclaim and harder to poison with weak evidence. For full details see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>Core runtime layers</strong></summary>

#### Observation & Planning State

`ObservationBuilder` and `ObservationFusion` produce canonical observations. `StateAbstraction` reduces them into reusable planning state — preventing DOM drift from exploding state cardinality and giving graph edges stable node identity.

#### Verified Execution

`VerifiedActionExecutor` is the core trust boundary. Each step includes pre/post observation capture, hashing, action execution, postcondition verification, failure classification, and trace recording.

#### Graph Learning

Transitions are recorded into a SQLite-backed graph with tiered knowledge: `exploration` → `candidate` → `stable`. Experiment and recovery evidence cannot promote directly to stable — only trusted, replayed outcomes earn that tier.

#### Dual-Agent Runtime

OS-domain planning (graph-backed UI interaction, ranked targets, verified execution) and code-domain planning (repo indexing, patch/build/test loops, workspace-scoped execution) hand off seamlessly in one bounded loop.

</details>

## 🛡 Safety Model

Oracle OS is intentionally conservative. Ambiguous policy states fail closed.

| | Examples |
|---|---|
| ✅ **Allowed** | Observation, inspection, safe navigation, workspace reads, local build/test/lint, safe git (`status`, `diff`, `branch`, `commit`) |
| 🔐 **Approval-gated** | Send/submit flows, purchase interactions, destructive file ops, `git push`, sensitive config changes |
| 🚫 **Blocked** | Terminal/shell UI control, arbitrary shell strings, writes outside workspace, force push, system file mutation |

<details>
<summary><strong>Governance contract</strong></summary>

- One hard execution truth path
- Reusable knowledge separated from episode residue
- Hierarchical planning with local execution
- Recovery treated as a first-class mode
- Architecture growth gated by eval and governance coverage

See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for the full normative contract.

## 🔌 MCP Tool Surface

Oracle OS exposes **22 stable public MCP tools** under `oracle_*` names:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Perception** | `oracle_context` · `oracle_state` · `oracle_find` · `oracle_read` · `oracle_inspect` · `oracle_element_at` · `oracle_screenshot` |
| **Actions** | `oracle_click` · `oracle_type` · `oracle_press` · `oracle_hotkey` · `oracle_scroll` · `oracle_focus` · `oracle_window` |
| **Vision** | `oracle_ground` · `oracle_parse_screen` |
| **Diaoracle-os** | `oracle_wait` · `oracle_permissions` · `oracle_doctor` |
| **Recipes** | `oracle_recipes` · `oracle_run` · `oracle_recipe_show` · `oracle_recipe_save` · `oracle_recipe_delete` |

## 🎛 Oracle Controller

A native local macOS controller for supervised operation.

```bash
# From source
swift build && open OracleController.xcworkspace

# Packaged app
./scripts/build-controller-app.sh --configuration release
./scripts/create-controller-dmg.sh --configuration release
```

The controller surfaces operator controls, recipe execution, trace inspection, policy approvals, experiment metadata, project-memory references, and architecture findings. First launch guides you through Accessibility, Screen Recording, and optional vision setup.

More details: [docs/oracle-controller.md](docs/oracle-controller.md)

## ⚙️ How It Works

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS task execution</strong></summary>

1. Observe the frontmost app and UI state
2. Abstract the state into reusable planning state
3. Query graph-backed or exploration-backed planner
4. Resolve targets through ranking
5. Gate the action through policy
6. Execute through verified execution
7. Classify success / failure
8. Record trace and update graph / memory

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Code task execution</strong></summary>

1. Classify the goal as code-domain or mixed
2. Index the current workspace
3. Retrieve relevant project-memory records
4. Run architecture review if the change looks high-impact
5. Choose a direct step or escalate to bounded experiments
6. Execute through the workspace-scoped runner
7. Replay the selected winner through the primary runtime path
8. Record trace, graph, and memory updates

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Project memory</strong></summary>

Engineering memory — not chat memory. Canonical Markdown in [`ProjectMemory/`](ProjectMemory) covering architecture decisions, open problems, rejected approaches, known-good patterns, risks, and roadmap state. The runtime writes draft records only; promotion to accepted memory is deliberate.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Parallel experiments</strong></summary>

Code tasks fan out into bounded candidate experiments (default: 3) using git worktrees. Candidates are ranked by: passing build/tests → fewer touched files → smaller diff → lower architecture risk → lower latency. Only the selected candidate, replayed in the primary workspace, can become stable graph knowledge.
